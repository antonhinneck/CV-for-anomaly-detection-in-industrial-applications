# Project description 
Damage and degradation of pipelines transporting petroleum and gas products lead to serious environmental problems. A lot of money is spent on eliminating breakthroughs and their consequences. To avoid accidents, it is recommended to improve diagnostics quality and to increase the frequency of the launch of pipeline inspectors. These are specialized robots (inspectors) that Identify defects and evaluate the thickness of the pipeline. Most of the techniques currently used for analysis relate to heuristical or traditional ML approaches and donâ€™t involve CNN or DL algorithms.  
The proposed project is the development of the algorithm for the automatic analysis of data from pipeline inspectors.  
It is supposed to solve the following tasks:
- Segmentation
- Defects classification
- Evaluating of pipe thickness
- New data generation (since the data is significantly valuable, and there is no publicly available real-world datasets)
