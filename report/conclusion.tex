%TODO magnetographic image
Today, manual analysis of a magnetographic image is a bottleneck for the diagnosis of pipeline transport, since it costs a lot of money and is limited by human resources. This study allows us to hope that this process can be fully automated, which is likely to make the analysis more reliable, faster and cheaper.
