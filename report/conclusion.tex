%TODO magnetographic image
Today, manual analysis of a magnetographic image is a bottleneck for the diagnosis of pipeline transport, since it costs a lot of money and is limited by human resources. This study allows us to hope that this process can be fully automated, which is likely to make the analysis more reliable, faster and cheaper.

There can be defined several project development options:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item better preprocessing, including manual pictures selection;
	\item multiclass classification problem solving for defects;
	\item defected welds detection;
	\item applying some common archictures like VGG or ResNet;
	\item adding layers to the last Convolutional layer for defect depth evaluation.
\end{enumerate}
